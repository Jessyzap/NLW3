# NLW3 - Discovery  

Website developed during the Next Level Week event (Discovery trail, suitable to beginners).  
I changed the original theme (proposal, colors, form) and I created a function that informs when registering, if a point on the map has not been defined.  

Suggestion for the future implementation of two buttons, one to delete the location and the other to change the form.  

#### The new proposal of the site is to create and locate markets and restaurants for people with special diets ***(gl√∫ten free, lactose free, etc.)*** and also for people who prefer ***organic products.***
